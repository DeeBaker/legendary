        <h3>Venue Information</h3>
        <p>•	Arrival- We recommend for first time performers to arrive 1 ½ hours early to get settled and allow the teachers to take them to the stage and get a feel for the stage about 45 minutes before showtime.  (4:30 arrival & 4:45- 5:30 stage walk through for 6pm shows AND 11:30am arrival and 11:45-12:30 stage walk through for 1pm show)  Drama/Musical Theater Classes will have Mic checks at 4:30 pm before each show, please do not be late!
•	Parking – Auburn High School is also hosting a basketball tournament on 6/11 &amp; 6/12 until about 7pm…therefore parking will be tight.  We suggest arriving early to allow yourself time to park as you may need to find street parking or park in the lot by the tennis courts.  
•	Seating – ½ hour before show time!  Make sure to print your tickets and bring them with you
•	The show begins!  We hope you stay for the entire show!  Younger dancers can sit on parents laps before or after they are done dancing.  Other dancers will need tickets if they want to see the show.  There are monitors in dressing rooms for dancers to see the show, if they decide to sit in the audience for part of the show we are NOT responsible if they miss their class performance. 
•	At the end of the show, each performer will bow and we will begin lining up the performers for their bows about 7 numbers before the end. After the show is completely over, the youth and jr dancers will be brought to their dressing rooms where a parent will need to come and pick them up.

        <h3>Dressing Room Info and Final Bows</h3>
        <p>Dressing Room Rules:  
•	YOUTH &amp; JR PERFORMERS- Performers 12 and under will NOT be able to leave the dressing room without a parent coming to get them
•	YOUTH &amp; JR CHAPERONE- The youth and JR room will have an Allegro teacher as a chaperone the entire time.  They will be guarding the door and will be there for the dancers if they need something.
•	USING THE SPACE WISELY- There is NOT room for everyone to bring their own clothing rack and dream duffle, (or to have parents hanging out in the dressing room the whole time.)  If you only have a few numbers, please leave your dream duffle at home.
•	FOOD AND DRINK- Only water allowed in the dressing rooms.  Anyone that wants to eat before or after the showcases can eat in the hallway that leads to the dressing room.
•	MONITOR TO WATCH SHOWCASES-  There are monitors in each of the dressing rooms for the performers to enjoy the show while they are not onstage.
•	PERFORMERS WATCHING THE SHOW- Performers do need a ticket to watch the show from the audience.  Performers ages 12 and under will need a parent to come and get them if you want them to go to the audience to watch.  Performers ages 13 and up are welcome to leave to go watch but we encourage the parents to have a conversation with them about when is the best time to do that according to their show order. We also ask them to give the Allegro teachers a heads up when they leave.  We will NOT be responsible for taking them to or from the audience OR for performers missing their pieces due to being in the audience too long.
•	END OF SHOWCASE BOWS- If you do go to the audience to watch, please come back 7 numbers from the end to start to line up for your bows:
After the class bows we will be acknowledging the following dancers: 
•	Performers of the month

<h2 id="#rehearsal-details">Dress Rehearsal cont.</h2> 
 <p>Please be early to allow yourself time to get to your assigned dressing room &amp; warm up.  We suggest doing your hair and make-up at home and maybe even coming in your first costume.
BASIC REMINDERS -  No jewelry (unless requested on the class costume form), No Nail Polish, No underwear lines
HAIR- See costume form for assigned hairstyles.   
MAKE-UP – All performers must wear make-up so that their facial features are not washed out on stage.  
•	Youth= eye shadow, blush, lipstick, and eyeliner/mascara if you can
•	JR/SR girls = heavier make-up than mom would wear to work and make sure to get a good foundation and powder underneath it all
Guys = foundation and powder so that their face is not shiny on stage and at least some eyeliner to outline the eye features. 
Quick costume changes - Teacher Sara has a list of quick changes to be aware of and will continue finalizing this list at Dress Rehearsals. Teacher Crystal will also be helping with the quick changes at the showcases.  Please make sure you communicate with her if you haven’t already.  The ‘Green Room’ backstage will be for quick changes as it is close to the stage.
Parents will not be allowed to be backstage and watch from backstage as there is NOT room.  Parents are, of course, welcome to come back to change their dancers but cannot remain backstage for the entirety of the show.  If your dancer has many quick changes and are worried about this… please e-mail the studio and we will continue working on solutions for you!
